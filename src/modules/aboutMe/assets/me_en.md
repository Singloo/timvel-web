## Summary

A full-stack developer on top of javascript, mainly do `React Native`, I can build a complete App by using`React Native`,`nodeJs`,`express`,`postgreSql`,`nginx`,`docker`. (see my github page).
<br/>I like `rxjs`, using a lot in my work. I also like `currying`.

## Experience

> ### Edugora, Full stack developer 2018-06 - Present

> 2019-01 - Present

I'm in charge of the company's new project, [Edugo ai](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1460558223). This app is for learning Mandarin.
<br/>
<br/>The main features are:

<br/>Users can do on demand video calls in the App. We record this call.
<br/>After the call, we process the video and audio, then extract useful content to generate review.

I built this App and back-end system from scratch.
<br/>
The difficulties of the App are:

- On demand video call
- Charge by mintues
- Process video and generate review

About the back end of this project:
- The recording sdk we use needs to be complied. To avoid recompiling every time when restarting the docker container, I built a docker image.
- The whole video processing has many steps,each step may fail,for some errors,I use `rxjs` `retryWhen` to retry.
